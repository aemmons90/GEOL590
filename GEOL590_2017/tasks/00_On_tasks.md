# The Meaning of Tasks!

GEOL 590 is about how to do stuff with R. Accordingly, you will be graded on whether you can do the stuff I think you should be able to do in R. 

Your grades in this class will come from completing a series of "tasks". Tasks will receive a binary grade: either you completed it (fully and correctly) or you didn't. You can't pass the class until you've completed all of the tasks.

Furthermore, although tasks are for individuals - you have to certify that **you** completed each task - no one in a group can have their task graded as complete until the entire group has completed their tasks. This gives each member of a group an incentive to make sure that all the other members are making good progress. Teaching is learning, as the saying goes, and working with other people on their code is a great way to learn how to code yourself.

## Accomplishing the tasks

Each task will come with an associated set of *resources*. Your best bet to stay on top of the tasks is to **finish reading the resources before the start of the week in which the corresponding task is due.** So for a task due on Friday, you should finish reading the resources by Monday. 

**Tasks will be graded on the honor system:** if every member of a group will vouch that every member of the group has accomplished a task, who am I to disagree? However, I will perform **spot checks** to make sure I agree that the task has been accomplished.

## Outside resources

I'll try to point you to all the resources you need to complete the tasks I give you. However, there is a ton of free information on the web about programming in R. I encourage you to supplement the resources I suggest with Google searches. One particularly useful resource is (StackOverflow)[http://stackoverflow.com/], a website for programming questions and answers. Most questions you will have in this class will already have been answered there, so searching with the R tag in square brackets ("[r] convert character to numeric") will likely yield good results. If you are quite certain that your question hasn't been answered, make sure to read (this)[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example] guide about how to ask a good question, including a minimal, reproducible example of your problem. 

## Hacking the tasks

I suspect the group-responsibility aspect of tasks will be eminently hackable, in the sense that there will be ways to get your tasks completed without learning or doing much work. **Please don't prove me right.** You all are (mostly) graduate students, and you're in this class to learn stuff that will help you finish your degree more efficiently and to gain employable skills. 

**I reserve the right to change the grading rules for students who, in my judgment, are not sincerely trying to accomplish tasks in a timely fashion.** However, I don't think you all are likely to try to cheat the system on purpose. More likely: you've got a bunch of stuff going on this semester, there's a particularly busy week, one of the tasks is suprisingly difficult, and you get behind. It happens to all of us. That's why tasks do not have a due date. However, it will be important to generally keep up with tasks. I suspect that any group that gets more than a week or two behind will have a very hard time catching up. *Therefore I also reserve the right to impose deadlines on groups that are, in my opinion, dangerously behind schedule.* Failure to meet these deadlines will result in grade penaties.

# Weekly schedule

We'll try to adhere to a semi-regular weekly schedule (which totally won't work in the first few weeks; see below). 
* Mondays I'll do something that resembles a lecture
* Wednesdays groups will work together. I'll mostly float among groups, answering questions and perhaps delivering mini-lectures as necessary.
* Fridays will be mainly for completing and checking out tasks. 

I encourage each group to set a regular weekly meeting time to help each other finish tasks.
