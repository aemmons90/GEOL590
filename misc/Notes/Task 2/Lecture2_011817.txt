	> object is anything stored in memory
		> a<-2; take the value of 2 and assign it to object a
	> functions as a subset of objects that do things
	> funtions include parantheses after their name; ex: functions(), a()
		> parantheses include parameters and arguments
		> data.frame(x=a,y=b)
			#includes parameters x and y
			#value of parameter x is a and value of parameter y is b
			# a<-c(1,2,3); #c creates a vector a with parameters 1,2,3
			# b<-c(4,5,6) 
			# to make the data.frame exist in memory it has to be assigned to an object
	>write.csv() #function creates a tab delimited file of data
	>understand value vs side effect and how these relate to functions
	>when we call a function a new environment pops into existence, which then disappears after returning a value to the global environment
