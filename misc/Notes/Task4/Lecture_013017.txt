Introduction to Data visualization with ggplot2

> R has multiple, distinct plotting systems
	> Base graphics
		> the base R graphical system is extremely flexible
		> A simple Base R plot
			> lets us make technically wrong and informationally non-sensical graphs
			> syntax can also be complicated
	> Lattice graphics
		uses R formula syntax, which is nice
		but it doesnt really have any advantages over ggplot2
	> ggplot2
		> wants you to describe a plot, not to build one
		> what do you need to fully describe a plot?
			> dataset
			> what kind of plot
				> (A geom: geom_xxx())
			> an aesthetic mapping ( aes() )
			> define the axes / data mapping
			> scales
			> a coordinate system
			> a faceting system (plot broken into components?)
				- graphing trends by factor?
			> "Decoration" (aesthetic aspects that arent mapped to data)
			> a statistical transformation (a stat: stat_xxx())
		> Things you cant do:
			> multiple axis plots
			> 3D plots
			> strangely transformed axes (unless you really try)
			> bar graphs, easily (why not?)
			> many discipline-specific plots
			If it is hard in ggplot2, you probably shouldnt be doing it anyway.*
	>Using ggplot
		> library(ggplot2)
		> p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=disp, y=mpg, colour=cyl)) +
			geom_point()
			print(p) #have to print to create the plot
		> print(str(p))> creates an object list
		> ?theme
		> library(ggthemes)
		> color brewer > colorblind safe
		>write code in an organized way:
			> ggplot call
			> geom(s)
			> scales
			> labels and other miscelleny
			> theme
